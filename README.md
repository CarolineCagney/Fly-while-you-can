In this program you are George the Bat, you are racing to get home before the sun rises.

On the way home you are attacked by different deadly weapons, such as stakes, crosses and garlic.

To get home safely all you have to do is dodge all the deadly weapons coming at you in the time limit.

While flying you will come accross drops of blood, by collecting these you will increase your score.
